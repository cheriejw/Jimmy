### Project Reflections

**Day 001:** 
This ended up being more of a review on CSS and HTML. Changing my attitude to just making it work with the tools I have chosen, I just wanted to work with the tools. I have noticed React was not a necessary/best choice for this project, in fact it is overkill and actually not optimal since I am just making a static site with anchors, and at most one view change.
React dom uses css file imports, versus native where it had a StyleSheet object. Doing this really takes the style out of code since no longer `style={{color:'blue'}}`. Not used to doing things this way but seems to be best practice.
