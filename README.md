React for Jimmy

### Good Resources
- [React Router (`react-router-dom`)](https://medium.com/@pshrmn/a-simple-react-router-v4-tutorial-7f23ff27adf)

### Project Reflections
This ended up being more of a review on CSS and HTML. I wanted to learn best practices but I do probably need more experience anyway which this is turning out to be. React was not a necessary choice for this project, in fact it is overkill and actually not optimal since I am just making a static site with anchors, and at most one view change.
